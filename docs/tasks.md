## Overview of the Two-Sprint Approach

- **Sprint 1 (Weeks 1–2)**:  
  - Focus on **setting up the development environment**, establishing **core smart contracts** for records and consent, **integrating an off-chain store** (IPFS), and delivering a minimal **end-to-end prototype** for record upload and retrieval.
- **Sprint 2 (Weeks 3–4)**:  
  - Enhance features with **granular consent**, **emergency “break-glass”** logic, and **IoT integration**. Perform **security checks**, **user acceptance testing**, and refine any necessary DevOps workflows for a production-ready proof of concept.

## Sprint 1 (Weeks 1–2)

### Goals

1. Stand up the **blockchain network** (e.g., a local Hyperledger Fabric or private Ethereum instance) and a minimal “EHR Manager” smart contract.  
2. Enable **patient and provider** onboarding (basic identity management).  
3. Provide a **simple front-end** or CLI to upload and view records.  
4. Off-chain storage integration (IPFS or cloud) to store encrypted records, with references on the chain.

### User Stories and Tasks

#### 1. Development Environment & Basic Infrastructure
- **User Story**: *“As a developer, I want a fully configured environment so I can run, test, and iterate quickly without setup overhead.”*  
- **Tasks**:
  1. **Set up repository** (Git, branching strategy).  
  2. **Spin up local blockchain** (e.g., local Hyperledger Fabric or Ganache/Hardhat if using Ethereum).  
  3. **Create Docker Compose / scripts** so the team can run containers for blockchain nodes, IPFS, etc.  
  4. **Continuous Integration (CI)** pipeline (basic checks/tests on commit).  
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Team can clone, run `docker-compose up`, and see a local blockchain + IPFS node working.
  - CI builds and runs unit tests automatically on push.

#### 2. Basic Identity / User Onboarding
- **User Story**: *“As a provider/patient, I want to register an account so that I have a unique blockchain identity for storing and retrieving records.”*  
- **Tasks**:
  1. **Design data model** for “users” (patient or provider roles), store them in a small off-chain DB or the chain’s identity contract.  
  2. Implement a simple **registration** function: `registerUser(name, role, pubKey)` in a **User/Identity smart contract** (or use membership in Fabric).  
  3. **Frontend** or CLI to prompt user for their name, role, etc., generate a keypair, and store public key on the chain.  
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Users can register with a CLI command or simple web form.  
  - The system records user info on chain/off-chain, returning a unique ID or DID.

#### 3. EHR Manager Contract & Off-chain Storage
- **User Story**: *“As a provider, I want to upload an encrypted patient record (lab result) so that it’s permanently referenced on the blockchain.”*  
- **Tasks**:
  1. Implement a **Record struct**: `recordId, patientId, hashCID, encryptedSymKey, timestamp`.  
  2. Write a **smart contract** function: `uploadRecord(patientId, fileHash, encSymKey)` storing references on chain.  
  3. **Integrate IPFS** for file storage: code that adds an encrypted file, returns a `CID`.  
  4. Basic **encryption** flow: Symmetric key for file, encrypted with patient’s public key (or a placeholder for now).  
  5. A **retrieveRecord** function or read-only query in the contract.  
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Provider can choose a file in the front-end/CLI.  
  - File is encrypted with a random symmetric key -> stored in IPFS -> `CID` is written on chain.  
  - Querying `retrieveRecord(recordId)` returns the `CID`, letting the user fetch the file from IPFS.

#### 4. Minimal End-to-end Demonstration
- **User Story**: *“As a developer, I want to confirm a working prototype so that record creation and viewing is possible.”*  
- **Tasks**:
  1. **Link the front-end** (or CLI) to the “EHR Manager” contract.  
  2. Test uploading a record for a given patient, retrieving from IPFS, and decrypting locally.  
  3. Write a **basic integration test**: end-to-end from user creation -> record upload -> record retrieval.  
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Clicking “Upload” in the front-end or running a CLI command successfully stores a record.  
  - Another user (or the same user) can retrieve the record by referencing the on-chain metadata and the IPFS content.  

### Sprint 1 Milestones
1. **End of Week 1**:  
   - Repository / Docker infra ready, local chain + IPFS running, minimal user contract.  
2. **End of Week 2**:  
   - Basic EHR Manager contract finished, with a demonstration of uploading and retrieving an encrypted record.  
   - Integration test passes showing the end-to-end flow.  

---

## Sprint 2 (Weeks 3–4)

### Goals

1. Implement **granular consent management** (smart contract or proxy re-encryption).  
2. Add **emergency override** logic (break-glass).  
3. Integrate a simple **IoT data flow** (optional but strongly recommended).  
4. Conduct **security checks** (penetration test, code audits) and finalize a stable “proof of concept.”

### User Stories and Tasks

#### 1. Consent Manager & Advanced Sharing

- **User Story**: *“As a patient, I want to grant or revoke a doctor’s access to my record so that my data remains private unless I explicitly allow it.”*  
- **Tasks**:
  1. Design a **ConsentManager** smart contract (or integrate with EHR Manager) that maps `(patientId, recordId) -> list of authorized userIds`.  
  2. **GrantConsent** function: patient signs a transaction specifying doctor ID, record ID, scope/expiration.  
  3. **RevokeConsent** function.  
  4. Update the retrieval logic: before returning an encrypted key or file reference, **check** if the user is in the consent list.  
  5. Possibly incorporate **proxy re-encryption** to avoid re-uploading data for each new doctor.  
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - The front-end allows the patient to select a record, pick a user, and grant or revoke access.  
  - Attempted retrieval by an unauthorized user fails.

#### 2. Emergency “Break-Glass” Access

- **User Story**: *“As an ER doctor, I need to override normal consent for an unconscious patient in a life-threatening situation, but with a fully auditable trail.”*  
- **Tasks**:
  1. Add a **breakGlassOverride** function that checks the user’s “ER doctor” role or requires multi-sig.  
  2. Log the reason code or incident time on-chain for post-incident review.  
  3. Notify the patient (if needed) once they regain capacity.  
  4. Unit test or scenario test verifying break-glass is only accessible to special roles.  
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - A designated “ER doctor” can forcibly read a patient’s record.  
  - The system logs that override so that an admin or the patient sees who accessed it and when.

#### 3. IoT Integration (Optional MVP)

- **User Story**: *“As a patient with a wearable device, I want my sensor readings to be securely stored so that a doctor can reference them when needed.”*  
- **Tasks**:
  1. Set up a **lightweight DAG or second chain** (e.g., local IOTA or a mock sidechain) for streaming device data.  
  2. Write a small **IoT Gateway** microservice that receives data from simulated wearables, stores the encrypted readings, and anchors them in the main chain.  
  3. A front-end or CLI to display the device readings for the patient or doctor.  
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - A script simulates heart-rate data.  
  - The data is posted to the DAG/sidechain.  
  - A “Merkle root” or reference is periodically anchored on the main chain.  
  - The EHR system can fetch the latest reading for the patient.

#### 4. Security & Testing

- **User Story**: *“As a security officer, I want to ensure the system resists unauthorized access or tampering.”*  
- **Tasks**:
  1. Perform **basic penetration testing** of the API (try to bypass consent checks, exploit smart contract vulnerabilities, etc.).  
  2. **Code audits**: check for reentrancy or logic flaws in the smart contracts.  
  3. **Add or extend unit tests** and integration tests covering multiple roles, revocation, break-glass, etc.  
  4. Possibly incorporate a **linter or static analysis** (e.g., Mythril, Slither for Solidity) if using Ethereum.  
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - No high-severity vulnerabilities remain.  
  - Consent checks pass negative tests (unauthorized user cannot read records).  
  - Break-glass override is logged and cannot be abused by a normal user.

#### 5. Deployment / Demo Prep

- **User Story**: *“As a project manager, I want a stable environment for demonstration so that stakeholders can see the system in action.”*  
- **Tasks**:
  1. Deploy the final version of smart contracts on a stable dev or testnet environment (or keep it local if that’s enough).  
  2. Prepare **demo scripts** (upload record, consent flow, emergency override, IoT device example).  
  3. Document usage in a short **README or wiki** (how to run the system, how to use the front-end/CLI).  
  4. Tag a “v1.0 POC” release.  
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - The system is running in a dedicated environment or stable local Docker setup.  
  - Stakeholders can view a live or recorded demonstration that highlights all features.

### Sprint 2 Milestones
1. **End of Week 3**:  
   - Consent Manager with grant/revoke is functional.  
   - IoT Gateway prototype sending data to an anchored ledger (if in scope).  
2. **End of Week 4**:  
   - Break-glass override logic done.  
   - Security checks completed.  
   - Demo environment up, with final documentation.

- **Tasks:**
  - Research and select an open‑source PRE library or framework compatible with your blockchain (or build a custom microservice for PRE).
  - Design and implement a PRE microservice that accepts a ciphertext (the encrypted symmetric key) and a re‑encryption request, producing a new ciphertext for the target recipient.
  - Update the Consent Manager contract to trigger the PRE flow when a new permission is granted.
  - Write unit and integration tests for the PRE workflow.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**  
  - The system re‑encrypts the symmetric key on demand without exposing plaintext.
  - A granted provider receives a re‑encrypted key that allows decryption.

#### 2. Multi‑Authority ABE Implementation
- **User Story:**  
  *“As a healthcare administrator, I want the system to manage access attributes using multiple authorities so that no single entity controls all attribute keys.”*
- **Tasks:**
  - Choose or prototype an MA‑ABE scheme suitable for healthcare (e.g., based on known pairing‑based constructions).
  - Distribute attribute issuance logic among different simulated authorities (e.g., one for “Doctor”, another for “Hospital affiliation”).
  - Integrate MA‑ABE key issuance into the identity service, so that when a user registers, they obtain attribute keys from different authorities.
  - Update encryption flows to support an ABE‑based wrapping of the symmetric key.
  - Create tests to verify that only users with the correct combination of attributes can decrypt.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**  
  - The system successfully issues attribute keys from multiple authorities.
  - Encryption/decryption using MA‑ABE works for approved policies and fails for others.

#### 3. Post‑Quantum Cryptography (Hybrid Approach)
- **User Story:**  
  *“As a security engineer, I want to upgrade our key wrapping method to be quantum‑resistant so that our system remains secure in the long run.”*
- **Tasks:**
  - Integrate a post‑quantum algorithm (e.g., CRYSTALS‑Kyber for key encapsulation) in a hybrid mode alongside RSA/ECC.
  - Implement a wrapper function that encrypts the symmetric key with both the classical and post‑quantum algorithm.
  - Update smart contract metadata to include an indicator for the encryption method.
  - Run performance tests to ensure the added PQ step doesn’t slow down operations excessively.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**  
  - The hybrid encryption process produces a ciphertext that can be decrypted by clients using either classical or PQ algorithms.
  - Performance remains within acceptable bounds (e.g., key wrapping completes in milliseconds).

#### 4. Hierarchical & Threshold Key Management
- **User Story:**  
  *“As a patient, I want a robust key recovery system so that if I lose my private key, I can recover access through trusted parties without compromising security.”*
- **Tasks:**
  - Design a hierarchical key structure where a master key derives per‑record keys using a secure key derivation function.
  - Implement threshold cryptography (e.g., Shamir’s Secret Sharing) in a microservice for key recovery.
  - Create a user interface for key recovery where designated trustees provide their shares.
  - Write tests simulating key loss and recovery.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**  
  - A patient can successfully recover a lost key via a threshold process.
  - The system logs the recovery event and prevents unauthorized recovery.

### Milestone for Sprint 3
- All advanced cryptographic features (PRE, MA‑ABE, PQ hybrid, hierarchical keys) are integrated with the core system.
- Unit and integration tests pass, and initial performance benchmarks are collected.

- **Tasks:**
  - Integrate a homomorphic encryption library (e.g., Microsoft SEAL) into a dedicated analytics microservice.
  - Develop a simple API that accepts encrypted data and performs aggregate operations (addition, average).
  - Prototype a secure multiparty computation (MPC) workflow for collaborative computation on data from multiple hospitals.
  - Design a ZKP module for selective disclosure (e.g., proving a threshold without revealing raw data) and integrate it with the consent workflow.
  - Create end‑to‑end tests: simulate uploading a dataset, running an encrypted aggregation, and verifying correct results.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**  
  - Researchers can request aggregate computations on encrypted data and receive correct, decrypted results without accessing raw data.
  - ZKP flows allow proving properties (e.g., “average is below X”) without data exposure.

#### 2. Smart Contract Refactoring & Formal Verification
- **User Story:**  
  *“As a blockchain developer, I want to formally verify the core smart contracts to ensure they have no vulnerabilities so that the system remains secure and robust.”*
- **Tasks:**
  - Refactor the Consent Manager and EHR Manager contracts to improve modularity and clarity.
  - Use a formal verification tool (e.g., Solidity SMTChecker for Ethereum contracts or similar for Fabric chaincode) to verify key invariants:
    - Once a record is registered, its hash cannot be altered.
    - Only the patient (or designated emergency roles) can update consent.
    - Break‑glass override functions only execute for authorized roles.
  - Document verification assumptions and results.
  - Run regression tests to confirm that contract behavior remains unchanged.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**  
  - Formal verification reports indicate that critical security invariants hold.
  - No critical vulnerabilities are found in the smart contracts.

#### 3. Extensive Penetration & Performance Testing

  - Analyze logs for anomalies and validate that intrusion detection mechanisms trigger when abnormal behavior is simulated.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**  
  - A security audit report is generated with actionable findings (all high‑severity issues resolved).
  - Performance benchmarks meet targets defined in your earlier sprint (e.g., retrieval latency under 1 second in high‑load scenarios).
  - All abnormal access or suspicious patterns are detected and logged as per design.

#### 4. Final Integration, UI Enhancements & Documentation
- **User Story:**  
  *“As a project manager, I want a polished demo and comprehensive documentation so that stakeholders and team members can understand and trust the system.”*
- **Tasks:**
  - Enhance the front‑end UI to support advanced consent management (e.g., dynamic consent, viewing audit logs, recovery options).
  - Integrate all new APIs and microservices with the front‑end.
  - Prepare detailed documentation: technical architecture, user guides, API references, and test reports.
